# Development Workflow and Future Extensions

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- Set up web interface framework
- Integrate preprocessing module
- Establish file handling and video processing pipeline

### Phase 2: Player Analysis

- Implement SAM2 integration with marker-based initialization
- Develop YOLO-Pose implementation for landmark detection
- Solve the mask passing between models

### Phase 3: Game State Detection

- Feature engineering from pose landmarks
- Train/implement CNN model for temporal pattern recognition
- Optimize for accuracy in state transition detection

### Phase 4: System Integration

- Connect all modules into cohesive pipeline
- Develop export functionality
- UI refinements and performance optimization

### Phase 5: Testing and Validation

- Validate accuracy against manually labeled data
- Benchmark processing performance
- Refine model parameters based on results

**Challenges and Considerations**

1. **Performance optimization**: Balancing processing time with accuracy, especially for web deployment
2. **Model integration**: Efficiently passing data between SAM2 and YOLO-Pose
3. **Temporal consistency**: Maintaining player tracking throughout longer videos
4. **Edge cases**: Handling unusual camera angles, player positions, or lighting conditions
5. **User experience**: Minimizing the required user input while maintaining accuracy

## Future Extensions

1. **Automated marker placement**: Reducing user input requirements
2. **Additional game states**: Detecting warm-up, timeout, and other specific phases
3. **Performance metrics**: Extracting player movement patterns, shot types, and strategies
4. **Multi-match analysis**: Comparing patterns across different matches
5. **Real-time processing**: Moving toward lower-latency analysis
